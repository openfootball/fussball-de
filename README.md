<!--
Tip - You can use the [`fbtxt2json` command-line tool](https://github.com/sportdb/footty/tree/master/fbtxt2json) to convert any file in the Football.TXT format to JSON. 

Let's try to convert the English Premier League 2024/25
in the Football.TXT format (see [`england/2024-25/1-premierleague.txt`](https://github.com/openfootball/england/blob/master/2024-25/1-premierleague.txt)) to JSON:

```
$ fbtxt2json england/2024-25/1-premierleague.txt -o en.1.json
```
